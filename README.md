# Basic-CV-Tasks for Exploring Deep Learning For Computer Vision
There are 03 different Tasks designed for practice and understanding the basics of deep learning for Computer Vision.
## Task-1
I have designed a simple convolution neural network for numeric digit classification. The provided dataset consists of three classes and the structure is as below:

hand_written_digits/
      0_digits/
        File1.jpg
        File2.jpg
     1_digits/
        File1.jpg
        File2.jpg
    2_digits/
        File1.jpg
        File2.jpg
